      <h1>About Me üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</h1>
      <p>Hi, I'm Lianna, an UI/UX Designer from Newtown, Pennsylvania! I'm currently a sophomore studying User Experience and Interaction Design at Drexel University. I'm passionate about designing human-centered solutions that put the user first.</p>

      <h3>Work Experience</h3>
      <p>Over the summer of my freshman year, I took an UI Quality Control internship for a health information company called IQVIA. Throughout the duration of the internship, I applied my learned knowledge of user interface design to test the interface from both backend and front end to make sure the user experience was as smooth as possible.</p>
      
      <h3>Involvement At School</h3>
      <p> At Drexel, I'm a member of the Art and CHI UX club. In addition to creative interests such as art and design, I'm also passionate about diversity and inclusion. As a result, I've also joined Drexel's Asian Student Association and Queer Student Union.</p>
      
      <h3>Extracurriculars</h3>
      <p>When I'm not working on school work, I enjoy working in other creative fields such as art, dance, and music. I have danced a variety of styles for many years and play guitar, ukulele, piano, and saxophone in my spare time. </p>
